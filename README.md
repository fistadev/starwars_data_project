# Starwars Data Clustering Project

## The Job

Challenges:

1- Find the approx location of baby
yoda is in the galaxy.

- 2D dataset
- Use KMeans
- Plot the clusters
- Find the coordinates of the planet where it is hidden
- Input it in the force finder

<p>&nbsp;</p>

2- Find where baby yoda is in the secret planet.

- Use PCA (top 2 components) to project the Jedi Force
- Use KMeans
- 5D Dataset
- Using classes

<p>&nbsp;</p>

_-_ Tasks

1. We think there are 3 different galaxies in our cluster of data find them
   and map them.
2. Generate a map only of the uppermost galaxy
3. we think BeBe Yoda is in the rightmost planet of this galaxy.Plot the
   highlighted planet on the original data
4. input the coordinates into the force finder
5. From the planet data you will need to extract the force concentration
   and its two principal components. Map them.
6. Find BeBe Yoda in the closest point to the gravitational center of the
   two principal components of the force. Highlight in a map the
   gravitational center and the closest point.
7. Deliver the force coordinates to high command.
